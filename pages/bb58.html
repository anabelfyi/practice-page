    <p>Another contender for being the first luxury watch I purhcase is the Tudor Black Bay 58 blue. I was lucky
        enough to try the watch on in person in October 2021. When I first tried it on, the BB58 blue instantly
        clicked with me. It was so light and comfortable on my wrist. I fiddled with the bezel and it's so crunchy.
        I love the sound of the bezel as you turn it. It's a very satisfying sound. The clicks are sharp and it's
        something I would fidget with if I owned the watch. The shade of blue is absolutely stunning in person.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I'm waiting to see if Tudor will release a smaller version of the Tudor GMT. I love the GMT but
        its a little too big and thick for my wrist. If they release a smaller version, I will definitely buy it.
        But for now, the BB58 blue is at the top of my list. I hope to own both the BB58 blue and GMT.</p>
