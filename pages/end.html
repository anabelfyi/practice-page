        <p>Well here we are. You've read through my webpage (thankfully). As you can see, I'm new to coding and I wanted
            to give you some background about myself. I hope to become better at this as I keep practicing. Today is
            Friday, September 10th, 2021. This is my first week of learning how to code. I am starting off with HTML and
            so far I'm really enjoying it. It's great being able to apply what I've learned so far. I love the
            satisfaction I get from writing lines of code, knowing I'm creating something completely from scratch. I
            like knowing I can create anything I can imagine. I hope I can go above and beyond and use my self-taught
            skills to land a job as a Front end Developer. We'll see...</p>
