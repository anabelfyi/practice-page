        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>Let's go through each project. I'll provide a high level overview of what each project will entail and what I
            want to accomplish with each one.</p>

        <h4>Bel's Sicilian Slices</h4>
        <p>The premise of the pizza shop is that it's a specialty shop that solely focuses on Sicilian slices. I haven't
            been to a shop that <em>only</em> sells Sicilian pies so I thought it would be cool to create a brand that
            focuses on this. The website will be fully functional and I hope to create a system where you can place an
            order.</p>

        <p>The orders submitted are all hypothetical of course. I need to figure out how I can create an online ordering
            system
            without asking people to provide their credit card information. I want the system to be a mockup of what it
            can potentially be if this was an actual pizza shop. Perhaps I'll ask "customers" to provide their first
            name, last name initial, address, and phone
            number. Then I can possibly create a email confirmation where customers can pay for their order through
            Venmo.</p>

        <h4>Ice Cream Shop</h4>
        <p>The ice cream shop will have a website where customers can place an order through an online ordering system
            or form. The online ordering system or form will only allow pickup orders. I haven't fleshed out the details
            for this particular project yet but I know it will be a little
            bit similar to Bel's Sicilian Slices.</p>

        <h4>Personal Library</h4>
        <p>This project idea is one I'm excited about building. I want to create a site where shows all the books in my
            personal library. I'll have a section that shows what I'm currently reading. I want to create a tracker
            showing the percentage of my library that I've actually read. Maybe it'll look like a progress bar. For the
            section of books I've finished reading, I'll have some sort of rating system. I also plan on scanning the
            covers of all the books I have so I can showcase my actual book collection online.</p>
        <p>I know this project will be hefty and interesting to build. I look forward to this one because I feel like I
            can really practice what I've learned so far and hopefully create a cool website dedicated to my personal
            library.</p>
