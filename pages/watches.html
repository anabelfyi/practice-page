        <h1>Ah yes... Watches!</h1>
        <p><em>Don't get me started on <strong>watches.</strong></em> I absolutely love these small, intricate machines.
            They are so fascinating to me. Watches are timeless, regardless of technological advancements.
            They stand the test of time, against digital watches, changes in fashion, advancements in technology, and
            much more.
            To me, watches will be forever timeless. They are always going to be an essential to anyone's wardrobe.</p>
        <p>You're probably wondering, "Well Anabel, what watches do you like?" I'm glad you asked!
            I can go on forever talking about the watches I like and hope to own one day.
            If I ever had to have a small, compact collection of 3-5 watches, these are the watches I would like to own:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <a href="../pages/gmt.html"><li>Tudor Black Bay GMT</li></a>
            <a href="../pages/bb58.html"><li>Tudor Black Bay 58 Blue</li></a>
            <li>Omega Speedmaster</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Granted, it's only three watches, but these are the watches I adore at the moment.
            I believe their designs are timeless and can be worn for any occasion.</p>
