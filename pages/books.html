    <h1>Current Reads</h1>
    <p>I recently finished reading <em>A Tale for the Time Being</em> by Ruth Ozeki. It was a phenomenal read. The
        book felt surreal at times. The story is split in two; two characters who are joined together by a diary...
        That's all I'll say for now. I highly recommend this book to anyone.</p>

    <p>Right now I'm reading <em>1Q84</em> by Haruki Murakami. It's a slow start right now, but that's probably
        because we're developing the characters before delving into the story. Don't get me wrong, the story is
        capitivating. It seems like there's a lot of character development, or rather, development of the details
        that lead into the plot.</p>

    <p>I'm glad I got back into reading. I felt as if I wasn't stimulating my mind when I wasn't reading.
        There would be times where I could watch TV for hours and I didn't feel engaged. With reading, I take my
        time reading the pages, making sure I absorb all the details. My favorite part about reading is imagining
        the scenes. I noticed that I'll imagine snippets of a scene. Or maybe I imagine the scenes vividly and it's
        only when I realize I'm imagining what's happening in the book I'll just have snippets of it. I guess
        subconsciously I can imagine what's happening fully but when I try to force myself to be aware, I can only
        imagine parts of a scene. I think I just repeated myself... But yes, reading is enjoyable and I love it.
        It's a privilege to read and to be able to <em>comprehend</em> what I'm reading.</p>
