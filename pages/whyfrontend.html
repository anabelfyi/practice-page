    <h1>Why Front-End Development?</h1>
    <p>Originally, I wanted to be a Graphic Designer. But as I soon learned, graphic designers don't make the best
        money, unless they work for a great firm or have great clients. I want a job that had stability and room for
        growth, a career where I can grow professionally and there's always a need to learn new skills. I dabbled in
        coding for a brief moment when I took an intro MIS course in college and I wasn't too keen on it at the time.
        But when I rediscovered it recently, it clicked. It was satisfying creating something in HTML and seeing it
        displayed on my web browser. I love the idea of having the ability to create whatever I can possible imagine. I
        told myself, I need to find a way to become a front-end developer.</p>

    <p>I love that anyone can learn coding or programming, regardless of their educational background. I like that you
        don't need a degree in CS to pivot into this field or tech. And so far, I really like what I've been learning so
        far. I love learning new things and I enjoy that I can easily apply what I learned to this page. I've been using
        this page as practice as I learn new languages.</p>

    <p>But yes, the ultimate goal is to pivot from marketing and become a Front-End Developer. I still enjoy graphic
        design but I want to do that on the side as a hobby. Initially I created my graphic design Instagram account to
        garner clients if I were to be a freelancer. But now I think I'm going to keep the page as a hobby and for fun.
        If I get clients, great! If not, at least I have an outlet to express myself creatively.</p>

    <p>I began my journey because I bought a domain name, <strong>anabel.fyi</strong>. Joe gave me the idea of building
        my website from scratch. I recall I was describing how I would like my website to look. He explained it'll be a
        great learning experiencing building and designing the website on my own. I did my research and saw how
        fulfilling web development can be. I just love how anyone can learn and create their own portfolio. I'm sure my
        skills in marketing and social media will help in terms of soft skills. Yes, the market is saturated but I know
        I'm determined enough to reach my goals. Right now I feel like I'm on a character arc where I finally know what
        I want to do, who I'll become, and what I need to do to get to the level I want to be. I think my character arc
        is me becoming a baddie. And honestly, <strong><em>it's happening</em></strong>.</p>
