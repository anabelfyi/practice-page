        <h1>What's Next?</h1>
        <p>As I'm going down the route of self-learning, you're probably wondering how I'll practice my newly learned
            skills and how I'll land a job as a Front end Developer. Well no one asked but I'm sure you're curious but I
            am planning on creating websites to include in my portfolio. I'm also looking forward to building my
            personal website.</p>

        <p>I have 3-4 projects in mind when I'm building my portfolio. As of right now, I plan on creating the
            following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pizza shop</li>
            <li>ice cream shop</li>
            <li>personal library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each project will include brand guidelines, assets, and a functional website. I want to blend my love for
            graphic
            design and coding. I figured by also creating a brand identity for each project as well as a functional
            website, I'll be able to truly showcase my skills.</p>
