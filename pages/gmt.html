        <p>When I was first becoming interested in watches 2 years ago, one of the first watches that caught my eye
            was the Rolex GMT Master II. It was timeless and chic. I heard that Tudor was a sister brand of Rolex and
            naturally I took a look at their website. I saw that they offered a GMT model. It looked similar to the GMT
            Master II
            but the colors were much more muted. I loved the subtlety of Tudor and when I learned more about the
            functionality
            of GMTs, I knew I had to have one.</p>

        <p>Why the Tudor Black Bay GMT? To me, the design of the watch is timeless. It's sporty yet functional.
            The Tudor GMT is everything I'm looking for in a first watch. I know for certain this watch is going to be
            one that I'll wear every day. I even imagine myself wearing it at the beach or at a restaurant. Plus the
            ability to track two time zones is cool. The GMT makes me feel like a traveller and motivates me to travel
            more. It's also cool that it has a water resistance of 200 meters (or 656 feet). I just find the watch very
            versatile. Definitely a great first watch to own.</p>

        <p>The only downside is that the Tudor GMT has a date wheel issue. The issue is that the date will be stuck in
            transition between two dates, or it'll skip ahead two days. Hopefully when I purchase this watch I won't
            encounter this issue. But the issue is known within the watch community. Luckily, Tudor offers a 5 year
            warranty so if that day ever comes, at least the watch will be covered.</p>

        <p>But long story short, I intend on purchasing the Tudor Black Bay GMT as my first luxury watch.
            It's one of the few watches that has caught my eye and when I tried it on back in April 2021, I knew
            this was the watch for me. It just felt right.</p>
