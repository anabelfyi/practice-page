    <!--Watches (oh boy...here we go)-->
    <h3>Ah yes... Watches</h3>
    <p1><i>Don't get me started on <b>watches.</b></i> I absolutely love these small, intricate machines.
        They are so fascinating to me. Watches are timeless, regardless of technological advancements.
        They stand the test of time, against digital watches, changes in fashion, advancements in technology, and much more.
        To me, watches will be forever timeless. They are always going to be an essential to anyone's wardrobe.
    </p1>
    <br></br>
    <p2>You're probably wondering, "Well Anabel, what watches do you like?" I'm glad you asked!
        I can go on forever talking about the watches I like and hope to own one day.
        If I ever had to have a small, compact collection of 3-5 watches, these are the watches I would like to own:
    </p2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tudor Black Bay GMT</li>
        <li>Cartier Tank Americaine</li>
        <li>Tudor Black Bay 58 (in navy blue)</li>
        <li>Omega Speedmaster</li>
    </ol>
    <p3>Granted, it's only four watches, but these are the watches I adore at the moment.
        I believe their designs are timeless and can be worn for any occasion.

<!--Why I want the Tudor GMT as my first watch-->
    <h3>Why the Tudor Black Bay GMT?</h3>
    <p1>When I was first becoming interested in watches 2 years ago, one of the first watches that caught my eye
        was the Rolex GMT Master II. It was timeless and chic. I heard that Tudor was a sister brand of Rolex and naturally
        I took a look at their website. I saw that they offered a GMT model. It looked similar to the GMT Master II but the 
        colors were much more muted. I loved the subtlety of Tudor and when I learned more about the functionality of GMTs,
        I knew I had to have one.
    </p1>
    <br></br>
    <p2>Why the Tudor Black Bay GMT? To me, the design of the watch is timeless. It's sporty yet functional.
        The Tudor GMT is everything I'm looking for in a first watch. I know for certain this watch is going to be one 
        that I'll wear every day. I even imagine myself wearing it at the beach or at a restaurant. Plus the ability to track 
        two time zones is cool. The GMT makes me feel like a traveller and motivates me to travel more.
        It's also cool that it has a water resistance of 200 meters (or 656 feet). I just find the watch very versatile.
        Definitely a great first watch to own.
    </p2>
    <br></br>
    <p3>The only downside is that the Tudor GMT has a date wheel issue. The issue is that the date will be stuck in 
        transition between two dates, or it'll skip ahead two days. Hopefully when I purchase this watch I won't encounter 
        this issue. But the issue is known within the watch community. Luckily, Tudor offers a 5 year warranty so if that 
        day ever comes, at least the watch will be covered.
    </p3>
    <br></br>
    <p4>But long story short, I intend on purchasing the Tudor Black Bay GMT as my first luxury watch.
        It's one of the few watches that has caught my eye and when I tried it on back in April 2021, I knew 
        this was the watch for me. It just felt right.

<!--Reading Books-->
    <h3>Current Reads</h3>
    <p1>I recently finished reading <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> by Ruth Ozeki.
    It was a phenomenal read. The book felt surreal at times. The story is split in two; two characters who are joined
together by a diary... That's all I'll say for now. I highly recommend this book to anyone.</p1>
        <br></br>
    <p2>Right now I'm reading <i>1Q84</i> by Haruki Murakami. It's a slow start right now, but that's probably
    because we're developing the characters before delving into the story. Don't get me wrong, the story is 
capitivating. It seems like there's a lot of character development, or rather, development of the details that lead into 
the plot.</p2>
        <br></br>
    <p3>I'm glad I got back into reading. I felt as if I wasn't stimulating my mind when I wasn't reading.
        There would be times where I could watch TV for hours and I didn't feel engaged. With reading, I take my time reading
        the pages, making sure I absorb all the details. My favorite part about reading is imagining the scenes. I noticed that 
        I'll imagine snippets of a scene. Or maybe I imagine the scenes vividly and it's only when I realize I'm imagining what's happening
        in the book I'll just have snippets of it. I guess subconsciously I can imagine what's happening fully but when I try to force 
        myself to be aware, I can only imagine parts of a scene. I think I just repeated myself... But yes, reading is enjoyable and I love it.
        It's a privilege to read and to be able to <i>comprehend</i> what I'm reading.

<!--ETC, ETC-->
    <h3>You've Come to the End of the Page</h3>
    <p>Well here we are. You've read through my webpage (thankfully). As you can see, I'm new to coding and I wanted
        to give you some background about myself. I hope to become better at this as I keep practicing. Today is Friday,
        September 10th, 2021. This is my first week of learning how to code. I am starting off with HTML and so far I'm really 
        enjoying it. It's great being able to apply what I've learned so far. 
        I love the satisfaction I get from writing lines of code, knowing I'm creating
        something completely from scratch. I like knowing I can create anything I can imagine.
        I hope I can go above and beyond and use my self-taught
        skills to land a job as a UX designer or web designer. We'll see...
    </p>
